# Annotation Data Transformation â€“ First Assessment Project

This repository contains my first take-home assessment experience focused on **data transformation and validation**.  

## Objective
The task involved:  
- Parsing JSON strings stored in a CSV file  
- Converting the data into valid **COCO dataset format**  
- Validating data integrity (e.g., missing annotations, duplicated IDs, mismatched categories)  
- Writing clean and modular Python code  

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data parsing and transformation with Python  
- Handling edge cases and ensuring data quality  
- Writing reusable and maintainable scripts  
- Experience with real-world technical assessments  

## Notes
ðŸ“Œ Raw datasets and reports are excluded to respect data confidentiality.  
Only the **solution script** is included for demonstration purposes.
